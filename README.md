# kaPong
this is my first kaplay game! it's basically pong but with custom assets (drew some of them, but most of them are from the kaplay crew, aka royalty-free assets created by the people who also made the kaplay framework) and slightly more customizable (you can change which character you want the ball to be)
it's a local multiplayer game, which means you can play against your friends on the same device, and if you don't have friends you can play against yourself lol
i made this project to learn kaplay and get into game development after a few questionable attempts with pygame and godot!
### how to play
- press "click me to play!" to play
- use w and s keys to control the red paddle on the left
- use up and down arrow keys to control the blue paddle on the right
### how i made this project
i used VSCode, vite and kaplay to make this project! it's deployed on itch.io.
### what i struggled with and what i learnt
- honestly this game wasn't too hard to make because i have a background in javascript (took the khan academy course when i was like 9 and also i do frontend webdev) so there weren't many struggles while making the actual game
- but there WERE struggles when deploying the game
- i forgot to run npm run build for some reason and zipped + published my source code... ðŸ’€ "why doesn't my game appear in itch.io?!" well... yeah so that was bad
- i forgot to add the base of ./ for my image files in my config so my images wouldn't appear
- i fixed all the issues and basically just learnt a bunch of stuff about kaplay so yay
